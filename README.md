# Machine Learning Press Analysis

## Synopsis

This repo will be used to collect my visualizations and assessments of press accounts of machine learning developments. I'll also include links to others' analyses. 

Suggestions and ideas are welcome. You can send them to: Cloudquistador@monroelab.com


Everyday there are media accounts about developments in the general field of artificial intelligence (often loosely defined) and machine learning. These accounts are interpretations or distillations or sometimes, hyped versions of the research papers which are the source of their subject.

In this repo, I'll collect my attempts to visualize (or, if visualization isn't possible, assess) the contents of media accounts to determine how accurately they reflect the research source material or if they reflect the actually existing state of the art (rather than hyped or misunderstood capabilities).

Full disclosure: my position on the current state AI and ML is shaped, in large measure, by the work of two researchers who've (perhaps reluctantly) taken on the role of myth and misinformation busters regarding real vs. hyped capabilities:

# Shakespeare/Fletcher Textual Analysis

# Media Outlet: MIT Technology Review 
## "Machine learning has revealed exactly how much of a Shakespeare play was written by someone else"

## Synopsis:

Text analysis is applied to Henry VIII to identify the relative points of contribution by John Fletcher and Shakespeare (per the 19th century work of James Spedding)

Research Paper: 
"Relative contributions of Shakespeare and Fletcher in Henry VIII: An Analysis Based on Most Frequent Words and Most Frequent Rhythmic Patterns"

Conclusion:  The MIT account accurately reflect the results described in te reasearch paper which are impressive but narrowly focused (i.e., an excellent and creative application of textual analysis without any excessive claims).



# Media Outlet - The Economist: "An Artificial Intelligence Predicts the Future"

## Synopsis:  

Economist reporter Tom Standage claims to have conducted an interview with OpenAI's GPT-2 (Generative Pre-Training) language generator. It's *implied* that the interview was a traditional question and answer, give and take and that, GPT-2, therefore, is an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) capable of participating in a coherent, ad-hoc conversation. This is challenged on Twitter by Gary Marcus, among others.  GPT-2 is able to generate responses but is unable to do so within the context of an actual conversation (language generation isn't the same thing as language comprehension).
