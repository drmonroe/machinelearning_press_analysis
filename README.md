# Machine Learning Press Analysis

Synopsis

This repo will be used to collect my visualizations of press accounts of machine learning developments.

Everyday there are media accouunts about developments in the general field of artificial intelligence (often loosely defined) and machine learning. These accounts are interpretations or distillations or sometimes, hyped versions of the research papers which are the source of their subject.

In this repo, I'll collect my attempts to visualize the contents of media accounts to determine how accurately they reflect the contents of the source material

Full disclosure: my position on AI and ML is shaped, in large measure, by the work of two researchers who've also (perhaps reluctantly) taken on the role of myth and misinformation busters regarding real vs. hyped capabilities:

Synopsis:

Text analysis is applied to Henry VIII to identify the relative points of contribution by John Fletcher and Shakespeare (per the 19th century work of James Spedding)

Research Paper:
